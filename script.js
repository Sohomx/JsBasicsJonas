//23. BOOLEAN LOGIC

/* FOR AND

 AND   | True  |  False

 True  | True  |  False

 False | False |  False

 True When ALL are True (no matter how many variables)

 FOR OR

 OR    | True |  False

 True  | True |  False

 False | True |  False

 True when ONE is true

NOT A, NOT B - inverts true/false value

A is False, !A is true,
If A is false, B is False Then the operator used is False.

//DECLARATION IS LIKE A COMPLETE SENCTENCE AND EXPRESSIONS ARE THE WORDS THATS USED FOR FILLING UP THE SENTENCE.
